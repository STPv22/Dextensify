## YOUR COMPUTER IS GOING TO CRASH WHILE USING DEXTENSIFY
This is inevitible, but it should work well after some perfect timing and after several attempts.

# What I've got the best luck from.

Some people suggest using <50 frames, some people hae better luck with 1000. At 50 frames, what I've used most, (If you do it right) you can disable the extention from anywhere from a week to a few hours. The easiest way at 50 frames is to press ctrl + t as soon as dextensify goes into action, after the 5 second delay and spamming 'allow access to file URLs.' Then, type the first letter of a websote you commonly visit, or prepare the website you wanna visit, I prepare play.geforcenow.com, and that seems to work well.
